> 
> *  I  always had passion for computers and technology. A few years ago I taught myself english as Portugese is my                    mother tongue. 
> * 
> * I did not know anything about Javascript, Ruby, Python, or that they were all computer languages... I did not know                  what a computer language was. 
> * 
> * One day I met a software engineer who became the father of my child. 
> * 
> * 
> * Everytime I watched him code, I was amazed at how cool it looked. I became instantly hooked when I picked up a                  book for the first time and attempted to learn. For quite a long time, I kept thinking 'How do I create  an app?' ,                          'How do I create a game?', 'How cool would it be to create my own  app? Or game?

> * 					We wake up in the morning to the alarm on our phone. We have an app to check what time our next bus or train                       will come. We have an app to search for a good to eat lunch/dinner. We have a few games, to help our kids be                        distracted if we are on a little road trip. 
> * 
> * 				 So I have always thought about what if one day, I can build something that would also be very helpful to many                          people? 
> * 				 
> * 
> * 				 One day, i decided to buy my laptop and I started to watch videos on "how to create a game, how to create an app                and many more... " 
> * 
> * 					Then I read a few books. I started to learn about HTML,  CSS and thats when I found out that computers had many                  languages. I started to read about javascript. it was really interesting to know you can actually build a website                          without using some kind of web tool. I always thought that was the only way to do it. I did not know, that you                              actually |code|. 
> * 
> * 				 Coding for me has become a passion. Coding is like drinking water, once I got hooked onto coding I cannot                              imagine my life without it. 
> * 
> * 				 Thats when i found out that, code, is not as simple as it might seen. Its like puzzles. and I have always liked to play                        puzzles. 
> * 					Its a lot of thinking. Its a lot of details and thats hard but its fun! I cant be bored when I am coding... 
> * 
> * 					I decided that I wanted to learn more and more. Thats when I found out about Flatiron. When I got accepted, it was                 really exciting to me. I have to admit that, I was excited but a little scared. I kept asking myself, if I would be able to                 do it. 
> * 
> * 					 I just love the idea of learning programing, that those doubts didnt stop me.  
> * 
> * 							 "I will just have fun" - its what i keep telling myself.
